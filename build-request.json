The redesign must include: (1) a refined card layout with a dark or deep-gradient background (e.g., deep navy, dark slate, or rich charcoal) contrasted with bright accent colors from the existing Gen-Z palette for CTAs; (2) a prominent trust badge or shield icon near the headline to signal security; (3) the UPI ID displayed in a styled, clearly readable block (e.g., monospace font in a highlighted pill or box); (4) the QR code / payment instruction area given a dedicated framed section with padding and a subtle border; (5) the transaction ID input field styled with a clear, premium look — larger padding, visible focus ring, and a descriptive label; (6) the 'Verify & Unlock' button styled as a high-contrast, gradient CTA button with a lock or checkmark icon; (7) subtle dividers between payment steps to guide the user through the flow. All existing functional behavior (submitting transaction ID, calling backend, error handling) must remain unchanged.",
