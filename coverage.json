The URL must be a real, publicly accessible resource (e.g., a Wikipedia article, MDN page, YouTube search results page, freeCodeCamp guide, or similar authoritative public URL) that is relevant to the plan's skillName and skillLevel. The URL must be deterministically selected based on skillName (and optionally skillLevel) from a hardcoded lookup table of verified real URLs — one per skill. The bonusResource title must clearly describe the linked resource.",
