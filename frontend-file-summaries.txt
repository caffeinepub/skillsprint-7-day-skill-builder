{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Vibrant Gen-Z OKLCH color system with electric purple, hot pink, cyan, lime, and orange palette tokens; Space Grotesk/Syne fonts; gradient text/bg utilities; staggered animation delay classes; shimmer, float, pulse-glow, badge-bounce, and XP-pop keyframe animations; colorful range input styling.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with Space Grotesk/Syne font families, neon color tokens (purple/pink/cyan/lime/orange/yellow), glow box shadows, and rich animation keyframes (slide-in-left/right, zoom-in, bounce-in, count-up) for the Gen-Z gamified theme.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations (createPlan, getPlan, getPublicPlanView, isPlanUnlocked, submitTransactionId) with improved error handling — `useCreatePlan` now extracts meaningful Motoko trap/rejection messages from IC errors and throws descriptive `Error` objects instead of swallowing them.",
  "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx": "App shell with glassmorphism sticky header featuring gradient logo, animated AI badge, and colorful footer with gradient caffeine.ai attribution.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProgressTracker.tsx": "Gamified 7-day progress tracker with animated XP counter (count-up animation), streak indicator, gradient progress bar with shimmer, colorful day buttons, and a badge shelf showing 🔥/⭐/🏆 milestone badges with bounce animations.",
  "frontend/src/components/PaywallModal.tsx": "Premium dark-themed paywall modal with deep gradient background, shield trust badge, copyable UPI ID pill (now set to `nidhi.aesticare@okhdfcbank`), styled amount display, transaction ID input, gradient CTA button, and an amber trust notice. All functional logic (submitTransactionId mutation, success/error states, copy-to-clipboard, unlock callback) is preserved.",
  "frontend/src/components/DownloadPdfButton.tsx": "Gradient-styled download button that generates a print-ready PDF with skill overview, day plan fields, end-of-week result, common mistakes, and bonus resource. Includes the same URL sanitization logic (`getSafeBonusResourceUrl`, `getReliableBonusResource`, `SKILL_RESOURCE_MAP`) as PlanResults to ensure the PDF always shows a valid working HTTPS URL; the bonus resource URL is rendered as visible plain text in the PDF output.",
  "frontend/src/pages/SkillInputForm.tsx": "Redesigned landing form with gradient hero, skill grid, level selector, hours slider, and outcome textarea; now shows detailed error messages from `createPlan.error` (with a Retry button to reset mutation state) instead of a generic fallback, and clears errors on user interaction.",
  "frontend/src/pages/PlanResults.tsx": "Results page displaying the 7-day sprint plan with hero card, progress tracker (using correct `totalDays`/`unlockedDays`/`onCompletedDaysChange` props), progress graph (using `boolean[]` state), day cards, paywall CTA, and post-unlock sections. Includes `getReliableBonusResource` and `getSafeBonusResourceUrl` helpers that fix broken Wikipedia \"programming_language\" URLs; all hook calls use `planId` as `string` matching the `useQueries.ts` signatures, and `PaywallModal` receives `planId: string`.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "TanStack Router setup with root route wrapping Layout, home route for SkillInputForm, and /plan/$planId route for PlanResults.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProgressGraph.tsx": "New SVG bar chart component showing 7-day sprint completion with vibrant gradient-colored bars per day, glow effects on completed days, checkmark indicators, and real-time updates when days are toggled."
