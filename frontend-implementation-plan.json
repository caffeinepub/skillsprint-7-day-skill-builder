Ensure destructuring uses 'objectives' (matching backend DayPlan.objectives), 'actionTask', 'practiceExercise', 'deliverable', and 'estimatedTime'. Convert estimatedTime (bigint) to a readable duration string. Add clear labels for each field in both unlocked day cards and the Day 1 preview card. Verify all five fields render for Day 1 in the public view and for all days when unlocked."
