AI outputs a structured plan with daily objectives, tasks, exercises, deliverables, and estimated time. Features a colorful, gamified, Gen-Z-friendly UI with animations/sliding transitions, interactive progress tracker, improvement graph, and personalized learning experience. Includes PDF download. Payment system is simplified: Day 2–7 remain permanently locked with blur; paywall section shows UPI ID, static QR code, and WhatsApp number for screenshot-based manual unlock (no in-app transaction ID input or auto-unlock).",
