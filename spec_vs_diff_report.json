  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for both REQ-39 (backend plan generation) and REQ-40 (frontend error handling). The backend main.mo is rewritten with a generateDayPlan function using a switch on dayIndex for all 7 days, and the frontend useQueries.ts and SkillInputForm.tsx are updated with improved error handling, retry logic, and proper error surfacing. Most requirements appear addressed, but some details warrant scrutiny.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-40",
      "requirement": "If the backend returns an #err variant, surface the error message from the variant payload to the user on the SkillInputForm page.",
      "reason": "The diff shows useQueries.ts mutationFn calls actor.createPlan and only handles thrown exceptions in a catch block. There is no evidence the backend createPlan returns a Result type (#ok/#err variant) — it appears to return a plain Nat (planId: bigint). The mutationFn does not check for an #err variant in the return value, so the distinction between an #err variant response and a network/call error cannot be fulfilled as specified by REQ-40.",

      "description": "The extractErrorMessage utility in useQueries.ts parses multiple IC-specific error message patterns (Reject text, Error from Canister, trapped explicitly, Call failed, IC error codes) beyond what was requested.",
      "reason": "REQ-40 only requests distinguishing between #err variant responses and network/call errors with a clear fallback. The multi-pattern IC error extraction is an unspecified enhancement, though not harmful.",
