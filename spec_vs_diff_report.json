  "summary": "The diff adds backend/migration.mo and modifies backend/main.mo to introduce a static resource mapping function. However, the implementation is severely incomplete relative to REQ-25 and REQ-26. Only a handful of skill/level/day combinations are defined — far fewer than the required 2–3 resources for all 6 supported skills × 7 days × skill levels. The migration logic exists structurally but falls back to empty arrays for most combinations, violating the core acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Every supported skill (Public Speaking, Python, Excel, UI Design, Photography, Writing) has exactly 2–3 resource objects defined per day (Days 1–7) in the backend mapping.",
      "reason": "The diff only defines a small handful of switch cases. The vast majority of skill+level+day combinations fall through to the default case returning empty arrays, violating the AC requiring non-empty resources for all 7 days of each skill.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Custom/unsupported skills fall back to a generic set of real resource links rather than an empty array.",
      "reason": "The wildcard default case in both main.mo and migration.mo returns an empty array for any unsupported/custom skill, directly violating the requirement for a generic real-URL fallback.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "All 7 days for each skill return a non-empty resources array when a plan is fetched.",
      "reason": "Because most day indices for most skills hit the wildcard default and return empty arrays, the vast majority of days across all skills will return empty resource arrays.",

      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Each day in every stored plan has 2–3 resource entries populated with real URLs from the new fixed mapping after migration.",
      "reason": "migration.mo getResourcesForDay has the same sparse switch table as main.mo and defaults to empty arrays, so migrated plans will still have empty resource arrays for most days.",
