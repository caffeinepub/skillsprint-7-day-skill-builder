The diff shows PaywallModal.tsx was modified and the file summary mentions the new QR image path, but the image file itself (upi-qr.png) is not present in the diff as an added file. Additionally, the path used in the implementation appears to be /assets/generated/upi-qr.dim_600x700.png rather than the required /assets/generated/upi-qr.png.",
